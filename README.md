# Panellist

An end-user-configurable dashboard layout system for Mithril

* A terse declarative API for customisable panels
* A seamless popout system that allows mutliple windows with a single exposed realm
* Judicious slice of OOP: Panellist allows you to configure the essential layout constraints but manages the hairy stuff itself
* All the essential FP: all panel view contents & interactions are exposed through a functional reactive API - no more configuring appearance!
